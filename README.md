hi!

this is a little adapter pcb i made so that i could use a qfn-package thing on a
pcb that was designed for a tqfp-package.

i had the atmega32u4 in mind when i made this, and the ground pins are connected
with that in mind. if you're getting this made for something else, then you
should change that!

for a fab, i recommend oshpark for little stuff like this. their boards are such
good quality; a real joy to work with. sometimes they're a little bit exxy, but
for something teensy like this you'll only be paying like $1 anyway.

here is what this looks like when you make it with oshpark's 'after dark'
service:

here is what this looks like in kicad (it's really not that complicated lmao):
